# Overview

Here I created an app that is able to load a json file from firebase and keep the file local to the device decreaing the amount of neede requests for the app to function well. I also add the fucntionality of saving your own articles to a favorites list and deleting them from the list as well and a way to view all your favorite lists.

# Development Environment

Android studio and firebase. I used JAVA and Kotlin to create the app and load the data without using an api like the last one.
